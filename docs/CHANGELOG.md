# CHANGELOG

## 2026-10-14 — videos now carry their audio (Whisper transcript) into the prompt
- `lib/server/extract/index.ts` — the `video` case only sampled frames; the audio track was
  dropped entirely. It now also runs `audioPcm()` + `transcribePcm()` when the clip has a
  decodable audio stream (try/catch keeps silent videos frames-only), capping the transcript
  to `TEXT_CHAR_LIMIT`.
- `lib/chat/client.ts` — the `video` prompt branch ignored `transcript` even when present;
  it now appends an "Audio transcript:" part. Exported `attachmentParts` for testing.
- `__tests__/video-narration.test.ts` — 4 new unit tests: narrated mp4 (muxed with the
  spoken-codeword fixture wav via bundled ffmpeg) yields frames + a transcript containing
  "zephyr"; silent mp4 stays frames-only with no error; prompt parts include/omit the
  transcript accordingly. 19/19 unit tests + typecheck pass.

## 2026-10-14 — fixed stream scroll jitter (top/bottom oscillation during generation)
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced the per-chunk `messagesEndRef.scrollIntoView()` auto-scroll with a
  single rAF-coalesced bottom pin (`pinToBottom` + `stickToBottomRef`), a scroll listener that
  disengages past 120px, and a wheel-up listener that disengages immediately on scroll-up.
  "Jump to latest" re-engages the pin. `messagesEndRef` removed entirely; added
  `data-testid="messages-scroll"` to the scroll container.
- `scripts/scroll-verify/{mock-upstream,check}.mjs` — SSE mock (:8081, 350 chunks @8ms) +
  Playwright sampler (40ms): FAILs on >120px drift, visible pill, or upward scrollTop jumps.
  Before/after proof: old code FAIL (2311px drift, pill 157/164 frames), fixed PASS
  (maxDist 24px, 0 pill frames, 0 up jumps). Kept as regression tooling.

## 2026-10-14 — sidebar multi-select delete
- `components/ui/Sidebar.tsx` — "Select" button enters select mode (checkboxes on every
  row, "Select all" toggle); once ≥1 selected the button becomes "Delete N". Selection
  state self-prunes when conversations disappear. Removed unused imports.
- `app/page.tsx` — `confirmDeleteIds` state + `confirmDeleteMany` (parallel DELETEs,
  deletedRef tombstones, clears open chat if it was among them) + second ConfirmDialog.
- `tests/multi-select-delete.spec.ts` — 2 tests: full UI flow (cancel path) and a real
  seeded delete verified via API 404.
- Note: the dev server's compiler worker had crashed ("Jest worker encountered 2 child
  process exceptions") making all API routes 500 — restarted; all 7 CRUD tests pass again.

## 2026-10-14 — file reading verified end to end
- `playwright.config.ts` — pins `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to `.data/ms-playwright` so the
  Chromium download stays inside the codebase instead of the user profile.
- `.data/ms-playwright/` — Chromium 153 + headless shell + winldd downloaded (gitignored).
- Ran the suite headed, in four slices, while the user watched:
  - Layer 1 `extraction API`: 106/106 (12.3 s).
  - Layer 2 `the model reads the file`: 22 + 13 + 58 + 13 = 106/106.
  - Layer 3 `formats that cannot be tested`: 3/3 (documents the .rar/.heic/.heif skips).
- `docs/STATE.md`, `docs/ISSUES.md` — created (neither existed before).

## Earlier this task (already verified, kept for the record)
- Added `lib/server/extract/` (office, rtf, notebook, archives, strings, pdf, ffmpeg,
  audio) behind `app/api/files/extract/route.ts`; deleted `app/api/files/extract-pdf/route.ts`.
- Added `lib/files/extensions.ts` (extension-first classification for the full format list)
  and rewired the client pipeline + attachment chips.
- In-repo deps only: `ffmpeg-static`, `@huggingface/transformers` (whisper), `7zip-bin`,
  `node-unrar-js`, `unpdf`. Nothing installed globally.
- `scripts/make-fixtures.mjs` — 106 fixtures + manifest; `tests/file-reading.spec.ts` — the suite.
- `.gitignore` += `.data/`, `tests/fixtures/`; `tsconfig.json` excludes `.next`, `tests/fixtures`.
